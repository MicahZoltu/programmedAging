# Introduction to Programmed Aging

Aging is the increase in the risk of mortality from internal causes. All evidence points towards a genetic basis of aging. Different genotypes of the same species have different average lifespans. The lifespans of identical twins are more similar than the lifespans of siblings who are not identical, and the lifespans of siblings are more similar than the lifespans of people who are distantly related. Aging genes —genes that, when knocked out, extend lifespan—have been found in every species in which they have been sought. Furthermore, aging genes are evolutionarily conserved. Why then has evolution not selected for greater longevity?

**Why** and **how** are two distinct questions. When we ask **why** organisms age, we're seeking the reason evolution has maintained health only up until a certain point, but not beyond, despite the potential to select for greater longevity. Asking **why** helps us construct a narrative on which to organize our thoughts. However, it is important not to become too fixated on the **why** of aging. When we ask **why,** we are essentially demanding that the universe make sense of itself— a plea that will undoubtedly go unanswered. A more practical approach is to focus on the **how** of aging. In the next section, we discuss **why** organisms age, but our emphasis will then shift to **how** organisms age, a separate and, arguably, far more important question. Understanding how aging works will give us the tools to address it directly, which is what truly matters. Overall, this discussion will introduce the **programmed aging** hypothesis, which is a theory on **how** we age. 

## Why We Age

There are two schools of thought on why aging happens. The first school posits that evolution has **directly selected for aging**, while the second school posits that evolution has **indirectly selected for aging** as a byproduct of selecting for something else. 

Let’s first define what it means for evolution to select a trait. Evolution is the change in living things over time. Evolution is ongoing. All life shares a common ancestor, and living things change over generations. These changes are not arbitrary. When we say that evolution “selects” for a trait, we mean that the trait becomes more common in the population due to factors beyond random chance and physical constraints. 

Aging is such a trait that cannot be explained by random chance or physical constraints alone. There is no law of biology or physics that states organisms must age. In fact, many plants and some animals do not age. Sequoia trees, for example, grow stronger and hardier with each passing year for thousands of years. Most organisms do age because aging has been selected for by evolution. The only question is whether evolution has selected for aging directly or indirectly. 

An example of direct selection by evolution is the development of thicker fur in animals living in cold environments. For example, polar bears have evolved thick, insulating fur that helps them survive freezing temperatures. An example of indirect selection by evolution is the development of non-functional nipples in male humans. Evolution directly selected for nipples in females for feeding offspring, and, due to shared development pathways, males developed nipples as a byproduct. The weight of evidence supports the fact that aging was selected for by evolution. There is disagreement, however, on whether evolution has directly or indirectly selected for aging.

The two most popular theories of why we age - Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Disposable Soma - are indirect selection theories. **Antagonistic Pleiotropy** is the theory that evolution selected for aging because evolution was constrained by the fact that genes that help organisms early in life are hurtful later in life. **Disposable Soma** is the theory that evolution selected for aging because evolution is constrained by the fact that genes that increase fertility also decrease longevity. These two theories of why we age are not mutually exclusive and are often combined when explaining why we age. 

Both Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Disposable Soma, as well as all indirect selection theories of why we age, assume that certain constraints on evolution play a role in explaining why we age. While it is true that evolution operates within constraints—such as the constraint of working with whatever already exists—there is no reason to believe these constraints are relevant to why we age. By observing nature, we can see that evolution has the ability to overcome any so-called constraint related to aging. Whatever tradeoff gave the mouse a lifespan of two years was easily surpassed in the squirrel with a lifespan of ten years. 

All indirect selection theories of why we age assume there was no evolutionary incentive to overcome certain constraints more than it has due to the Selection’s Shadow hypothesis. **Selection’s Shadow** is the theory that the force of selection is weaker for chronologically old organisms than it is for chronologically young organisms, creating a "shadow" where there is limited evolutionary incentive to select for traits after a certain chronological age. 

The Antagonistic Pleiotropy theory of why we age clearly implies the Selection Shadow hypothesis. Since cells have mechanisms to turn genes on and off, the failure to turn off genes that are harmful in old age is attributed to limited evolutionary pressure to do so. Similarly, the Disposable Soma theory also implies the Selection Shadow hypothesis. The mouse could theoretically have its lifespan extended without affecting fertility—at least up to that of a squirrel. However, according to the Disposable Soma theory, there is limited evolutionary incentive to do so. According to the Disposable Soma theory, once an organism has successfully reproduced, the evolutionary forces maintaining the health of the soma (the body) weaken. 

The **Selection’s Shadow** hypothesis, implied by all indirect selection theories of aging, predicts that aging is not a significant cause of death in the wild. According to this hypothesis, evolution had little incentive to prevent aging since aging was not a major threat to survival in the wild. However, this prediction is contradicted by evidence from over a century of field studies, which show **increasing hazard rates**—the risk of death rising with age—across many most species in the wild. Consequently, the Selection’s Shadow hypothesis is incorrect, and by extension, all indirect selection theories of why we age, which rely on this premise, are also incorrect.

It is important to note not all organims that age also age in the wild. A famous example of an organism that does not age in the wild is the African killifish *Nothobranchius furzeri*. This killifish has a unique life cycle adapted to its habitat of ephemeral pools. In many arid regions, precipitation is erratic and seasonal, which produces temporary pools. The African killifish, *Nothobranchius furzeri* are born in such temporary pools, lay desiccation-resistant eggs in such pools, and then all die at once when the pools dry up. In this case, environmental factors, rather than aging, dictate their survival. For *Nothobranchius furzeri*, aging is not a significant cause of death in the wild. However, when this killifish is raised in a lab environment, where water never dries up, this killifish does age and typically dies within a year, depending on the strain. Remarkably, *Nothobranchius furzeri* aging exhibits many of the same hallmarks as human aging, including scoliosis, neurodegeneration, and cancer. For *Nothobranchius furzeri*, aging is an artifact of the lab. The Selection's Shadow hypothesis views all aging as an artifact of the lab as well. This is not what we observe in nature. In general, aging is not merely a laboratory artifact; it is a significant cause of death in the wild for almost all species.

Thus, evolution has directly selected for aging. Aging - **the most striking feature of every organism** - is not an unintended consequence of evolution. Rather, aging is an adaptive trait just like most other important traits, such as average height or time of maturation. The criticism of the direct selection theory of why we age is that this theory implies group selection. **Group selection** is the idea that evolution can favor traits that are beneficial to a population or ecosystem even when those traits are detrimental to individuals. Group selection has largely been discredited because it leads to conclusions that conflict with the way biologists typically understand evolution.

Specifically, group selection challenges the idea that an organism’s evolutionary fitness is solely measured by its ability to produce fertile offspring. Group selection introduces the need for an additional evolutionary mechanism beyond natural selection, which only focuses on the survival and reproduction of individuals. Since no concrete evidence has been found to support a mechanism of evolution beyond natural selection, many biologists view this line of reasoning as speculative, and more of a leap of faith than science.

I view a lack of group selection as more of a leap of faith than science. Even though no mechanism for group selection has been discovered, animals aging in the wild implies direct selection of aging which implies group selection. Group selection provides a more comprehensive view of nature, and explains the stability and interconnectedness of ecosystems. Most biologists argue that the robustness and stability of ecosystems emerge naturally from individual genes maximizing their own reproductive success. However, I find this assumption to be unconvincing and a large leap of faith. **Individual genes looking out for their own self-interest do not make a robust ecosystem.**

By not acknowledging the possibility of group selection, I believe most biologists are missing how the natural world truly operates. This situation can be compared to not acknowledging the electromagnetic force just because no one has discovered the precise mechanism behind this force.

## How We Age

Aging is deferred until after sexual maturation. 

Why and How are two distinct questions. It is important not to get caught up in the "why" of aging. When we ask "why," we are essentially demanding that the universe make sense of itself— a plea that will undoubtedly go unanswered. Instead of grappling with existential questions, a more pragmatic approach would be to focus on "how," particularly in understanding processes like aging. 

There are two schools of thought on how aging happens. The first school posits that aging is the result of a **passive accumulation of damage**, while the second school posits that aging is the result of **active self-destruction pathways**. 

Note that the theory that aging was indirectly selected for by evolution is compatible with both the theory that aging is the result of an accumulation of damage and the theory that aging is self-destruction. It is perfectly logical for aging to be indirectly selected for due to a trade-off between longevity and fertility, and the how of aging is an active self-destruction program that increases fertility at the expense of lifespan. However, the theories of why we age do influence one’s theory of how we age. If aging is directly selected for, then this suggests that aging is the result of active self-destruction pathways.

If aging is the result of a passive accumulation of damage, then the body is trying its best to survive but damage accumulates, nonetheless. This school prescribes working with the body by developing therapeutics that clear damage at the cellular level. If aging is the result of active self-destruction, then the body might already have the ability to clear any damage that has accumulated. A second school of thought argues that the body is not trying its best to survive, and therapeutics should be developed with the goal of interfering with the body’s chemical pathways rather than working with the body. 

There are clear examples of programmed aging in nature, such as the sudden death after reproduction in semelparous animals and monocarpic plants.

The theory that aging is the result of active self-destruction pathways suggests important hypotheses. These hypotheses are non-falsifiable. If we look somewhere and do not find an aging clock, we have no way of knowing whether there is no clock or we just did not look hard enough. The only way such an existence statement can be proven is by finding the clock. However, the existence of many important biological phenomena, such as programmed cell death, also started as non-falsifiable hypotheses. 

### Hypotheses

***1. The body’s developmental clock also governs aging.***
There is a biological clock governing development and puberty, and perhaps menopause. This clock may be related to the circadian oscillators in each cell and the yearlong oscillators governing molting, hibernation, and breeding seasons. Programmed theories of aging view aging as a stage of development. Thus, programmed theories of aging suggest that the developmental clock likely also governs aging. Nonprogrammed theories of aging, on the other hand, view aging as a side effect of the body program, and thus do not believe the rate of aging is governed by signals from the developmental clock. Thus, programmed and nonprogrammed theories disagree on whether the developmental clock should be a target of therapeutics. 

***2. The body controls aging through a robust signaling network.***
Programmed theories of aging view aging as being directly selected for by evolution and robust to stochastic mutations that may arise in evolution. This is why we do not see extremely long lived mutants. This suggests that the body’s aging program is robust. If signals in the aging program are knocked down, the body will respond by upregulating different signals that have the same downstream effect. This is a clear difference of prediction with nonprogrammed theories of aging. From the nonprogrammed perspective, mutations do not cause life extension because the body is already trying its best to survive. Knocking out aging signals are not robust, since the tradeoff will punish such mutations anyway. 

***3. Organisms have the ability to remain young indefinitely.***
Programmed theories of aging explain rejuvenation as turning back the biological clock, and believe that organisms have the ability to remain young indefinitely if the body receives youth signals from the biological clock. Programmed theories view an old body as a body that has not lost its ability to function - just look how well it is running the aging program! Nonprogrammed theories, on the other hand, view old bodies as worn out. These theories believe that, in general, only the germline can be rejuvenated and the soma has no ability to rejuvenate itself. Epigenetic reprogramming is explained as taking advantage of 

***4. Evolution often wants organisms to enter into the grandfatherly role in their populations.*** 

***5. There may be two distinct aging programs: a sudden death program and a gradual aging program.***

***6. There are other mechanisms of evolution other than natural selection.***

Here are experiments that will provide evidence for these hypotheses.
