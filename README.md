# Introduction to Programmed Aging

Aging is the increase in the risk of mortality from internal causes. All evidence points towards a genetic basis of aging. Different genotypes of the same species have different average lifespans. The lifespans of Identical twins are more similar than the lifespans of siblings who are not identical, and the lifespans of siblings are more similar than the lifespans of people who are distantly related. Aging genes —genes that, when knocked out, extend lifespan—have been found in every species in which they have been sought. Furthermore, aging genes are evolutionarily conserved. Why then has evolution not selected for greater longevity?

## Why We Age

There are two schools of thought on why aging happens. The first school posits that evolution has **directly selected for aging**, while the second school posits that evolution has **indirectly selected for aging** as a byproduct of selecting for something else.
